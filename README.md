# Music Playlist

### Project 2 - Playlist

###### Completed by Lanique Peterson

The goal for this project is to build a Playlist using a linkedlist.

You are given:
* *playlist.cpp* 
Implementation file for the playlist class
* *playlist.h* 
Header file for the playlist class
* *main.cpp* 
A main file that you should compile to test your playlist class

All required functions for this project can be found in playlist.h and the implementation skeletons can be found in playlist.h
I've also added two structs in playlist.h, you also are tasked to complete the default constructors for the Song struct.

The Song struct represents meta-data about a song in our playlist, mainly the title of the song and the duration of said song.
The PlayListNode is the node component of our linkedlist, it contains a pointer to the song and a pointer to the next node. You won't have to do much with this struct.

You are allowed to add any public/private variables/member functions as you like as long as you retain and keep the default functions and structs I have provided you.
