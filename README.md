Project 3 - Browser Nagivator

For this project we want to focus on common use case within browsers, more specifically the history and back features that can be found in many popular browsers (Chrome/Firefox).

You are given the following files:
browser.cpp/browser.h - This class should emulate a browser's nagivator (Storing visited websites per session and allowing the user to navigate back a page,similar to pressing the back button in a browser)
queue.cpp/queue.h -  You should implement a fully functional queue using a struct called QueueNode. Please also define the constructor for QueueNode that will set the website to the provided string.
stack.cpp/stack.h - You should implement a fully functional stack using a struct called StackNode. Please also define the constructor for StackNode that will set the website to the provided string.
main.cpp - A file that you should be able to compile to test your classes.


You are allowed to add any public/private variables/member functions as you like as long as you retain and keep the default functions and structs i have provided you.

A simple main.cpp is provided for you to use to iteratively test your class.
To compile run the following (assuming you're in the directory of all files):
g++ main.cpp -std=c++11
To execute your binary run the following (assuming you did not rename the output):
./a.out

When submitting to gradescope you should only submit .cpp and .h files, the main.cpp is not required.
You should only submit to gradescope when you have finished all the required functions.
