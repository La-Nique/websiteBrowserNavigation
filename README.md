# Web Browser Nagivator

### Project 3 - Browser Nagivator

###### Completed by Lanique Peterson

For this project we want to focus on common use case within browsers, more specifically the history and back features that can be found in many popular browsers (Chrome/Firefox).

You are given the following files:
* *browser.cpp/browser.h* <br> This class should emulate a browser's nagivator (Storing visited websites per session and allowing the user to navigate back a page,similar to pressing the back button in a browser)
* *queue.cpp/queue.h* <br> You should implement a fully functional queue using a struct called QueueNode. Please also define the constructor for QueueNode that will set the website to the provided string.
* *stack.cpp/stack.h* <br> You should implement a fully functional stack using a struct called StackNode. Please also define the constructor for StackNode that will set the website to the provided string.
* *main.cpp* <br> A file that you should be able to compile to test your classes.
